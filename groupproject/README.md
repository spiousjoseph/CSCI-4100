# On Tech Carpool

## What is this?

We have made a carpool app that allows users to connect with drivers and carpool together to Ontario Tech University. Simply just sign up and find a driver today. All information sent towards signing up is saved safely on firebase cloud so your information is safe. 

## Features

Cloud storage for all of your data, Functional map with geolocation tools added to quickly help find drivers near you, English and French localization support, Easy to read User interface to make life easier, Every tool you will need to help manage your carpool needs. Future updates will include chat functionality, In-App money transfers to send help the driver with gas costs, Camera functionailty for the driver to take a picture of their gas bill, Update notifications to show driver information on tap from the passenger map view, and much more.

## Known Bugs

Data table for passengerlist.dart does not handle selection visuals proper however will still operate the same as if it did. So if user were to tap the check box, the checkbox will not refresh with a checked state however will register to the program that it is selected and have the same functionality as proven when an attempt to delete the passenger is made
